"""Evaluates nested entity predictions.
The predictions are supposed to be in the following format:
One entity mention per line, two columns per line separated by table. First
column are entity mention token ids separated by comma, second column is
a BIO or BILOU label. Only classes are compared, the B-, I-, L- and U-
prefixes are stripped.
